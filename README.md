# EVE-MarketPasta

This program's job is actually pretty simple:

* Check if the clipboard contains a sell order
* Replace the clipboard contents with a price that will undercut that sell order

So basically, you copy the lowest priced market order with Ctrl-C
and press Ctrl-V when entering your item price.
